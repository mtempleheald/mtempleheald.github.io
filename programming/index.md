# Programming Languages

I've experimented with many programming languages over the years, some professionally, others as learning exercises.  
I don't feel that I could call myself an expert in any, but I can use them to varying degrees of success.  My focus is always on the problem, or more specifically the solution to it, rather than the means to an end wich is the framework, or library.  Loosely in the order in which I encountered them:

* Fortran  
  My only foray into programming on my university course.  I never got into it, experiencing all the frustration of programming with none of the satisfaction.
* Matlab  
  Technically I guess I just lied, however I only used Matlab for matrix multiplication on my final year university project around neutrino oscillations.
* JavaScript  
  Taking advantage of university website hosting for simple stuff like bookmarking before browser bookmarks were commonplace.  Rounded corners was about the pinnacle of my JS work, prior to CSS doing this for us.  I'm liking the recent improvements though I'm not fully up to speed yet.
* PHP  
  An extension of my earlier web work, when I needed forms.  Free hosting was the reason I chose this, but the documentation was bloody awful and the language inelegant, I wouldn't choose to use it again although I read that it has greatly improved.
* VBA  
  My first professional programming work.  Technically not what I was employed to do, however I did get paid for the time.  Automating my job down to 30 minutes per day allowed me to automate other processes, then I moved over to IT and here we are 10 years later.  I occasionally still dabble with this, Excel is a great platform for toy applications.
* PL/SQL  
  Probably the language I have most experience in.  Quite verbose and not particularly fun to work with but generally effective.  The main downfall here is the tight coupling to the Oracle ecosystem, which is not well trusted.  Personally I rate the database greatly, but most of the Oracle tools are terrible.
* Java  
  I found the JVM concept novel and intriguing, at the time it seemed like the right direction.  I have however experienced enough configuration issues to rethink this, when I found Go I shifted my preferences.
* Go  
  I'd read about this for a while when looking into Google App Engine.  I abandoned App Engine because I disliked the clear lock-in nature.  I think I've learnt enough since to avoid such issues.  Go itself, great for web servers, simple XML processing and command line integration, exactly what I was looking for.  Love the tooling.  Not so good for recursion, functional programmingor type safety.
* Latex  
  I was looking for a free pixel perfect reporting solution for the CV, I hate Word which was used even for Oracle BI Publisher.  I never intended to master Latex, just enough to get a decent layout in a repeatable fashion.
* C#  
  Big switch at work from Oracle to Microsoft brought me to C#.  I guess the simplest description would be a simpler Java; no big surprises, not all that exciting but ultimately effective.  Learning C#, Visual Studio, .NET, BizTalk and TFS/VSTS all at once is quite a learning curve, however.
* T_SQL  
  I like to learn through comparisons, overall I think I prefer PL/SQL and the Oracle database in general, however the user management in SQL Server makes much more sense than that in the Oracle database.
* Haskell  
  Stumbling across lambda functions in C# led me down a rabbit hole which brought me to Haskell's door.  Challenging would be a fair summary, it took a long time and a lot of reading to ultimately discover a solution which is extremely elegant and simple.
* F#  
  Inspired to do practical stuff in a functional style, F# seemed like a perfect contender.  I'd reconsider but Rust seemed more exciting.
* Rust  
  Best of everything, but a massive learning curve.  Tooling and documentation as good as Go or better, performance as good as anything I've used, support for higher level functions, type safety and cross-compilation but pragmatic too.

Considered but barely touched
* Ruby  
  Installed because it was a pre-requisite for something.  Sass? Less? Latex? I can't remember now.  I read a bit but I don't see much of a future here.
* Scala  
  I'd gone off the JVM idea by now, all reviews alluded to extreme complexity and I generally got the feeling that this language came from theory not practice, not what inspires me.
* Python  
  Obviously massive for AI, Neural networks, deep learning and for this reason I'm vaguely interested.
* Julia  
  Sounds like a great alternative to python, touted as high performing with JIT compilation but not got around to this yet.
* R  
  Again, data science seems to like this, therefore coule be interesting.
* Kotlin  
  If I were to create android apps, I'd choose to do it in Kotlin over Java, but otherwise no real interest.
