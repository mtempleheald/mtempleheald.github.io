<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtempleheald" rel="nofollow">Mark Temple-Heald</a> is an experienced polyglot software developer living in Manchester, UK.<br>
Technology agnostic but favour code over configuration, libraries over frameworks and automation whenever possible.<br>
Methodology agnostic but favour prioritisation over planning, collaboration over co-ordination and focus on common understanding throughout.  </p>
<h2>Website Purpose</h2>
<p>This website serves many purposes, including:</p>
<ul><li>public face for my professional work which affords more flexibility than LinkedIn</li>
<li>centralised list of useful technical references, replacing browser bookmarks and enabling a clear separation of work and home</li>
<li>centralised information store for technology and processes for which I feel justified to have an opinion</li>
<li>blog of ongoing investigations where sharing is appropriate or could benefit others</li>
<li>single source of truth of data for LinkedIn, CV and other professional entities</li>
<li>encouraging a continuous process of self improvement</li></ul>
<h2>Website Structure and design choices</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time reading technical reference manuals, blogs and videos.<br>
I have developed quite strong opinions on what amongst these works well.<br>
With this in mind I’ve structured this website according to the following principles:  </p>
<ul><li><strong>Video</strong> can be useful but is not an efficient way to learn, I always look for the written transcript.</li>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> insufficient on its own - very focused points are great, if you’re trying to achieve the same thing, but at least it is timely.</li>
<li><strong>Topical documentation useful</strong> but there must be an indication of timeliness or the information can’t be trusted.  </li>
<li><strong>Succinct</strong> - I’m sick of reading long introductions and caveats in blogs, this is written for my level of understanding not as click bait.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed</strong> - when reading an article I shouldn’t need to go off-site to fill in <em>important</em> gaps, the document should stand alone.</li>
<li><strong>Focused</strong> - documentation should be modular just as code should, split dependencies or sidetracks into a separate document.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid repetition</strong> - if there’s a good, detailed blog somewhere else for the same topic, just reference that and add benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile-friendly</strong> is important, cosmetics and user experience not so much, I am the target audience.</li></ul>
<h2>Commitment</h2>
<p>I’ve spent a considerable amount of time configuring this site to suit my needs and facilitate simple ongoing maintenance.<br>
I have every intention of keeping this (or a future version of this) up to date for the rest of my career.<br>
However, I can not and will not promise to succeed in this aim.<br>
My only commitment is that the information provided here was true to the best of my knowledge at the time of writing.<br>
Each page should clearly indicate when it was last updated.  </p>
<p>My opinions are my own and they are in constant flux.<br>
You may disagree with something I have written, that is absolutely fine, it is entirely possible that I also do too, now.<br>
I am always interested in learning, feel free to contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtempleheald" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a> if you think we have something to offer each other in this respect.  </p></main>

  <p>Mindful meanderings manifest more manageable machinations.
    Manoeuvring murky multifaceted modernism means meticulously managing many mistakes, misconceptions, misunderstandings.
    Measured multipronged musings, mechanical movements, may maximise meritorious magnificence.
