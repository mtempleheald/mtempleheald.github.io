Structure:

Opting to avoid blog structure, preferring more formal structure where I can find my own useful notes.

Index   
    > Topics
        > Short topic
            [topic name](topic index)
        > Longer Topic
            [topic name](topic index)
                > [section name](section page)
    > Projects
        > Project 1
        > Project 2

Maintenance:

Each page should have last modified date and created date.  
Possibly pull the latter from original commit in post-commit hook, the other may need to be manually maintained, unless Jekyll can pull latest commit from Git repo.
