## Mark Temple-Heald

An IT professional with experience of software development, data modelling, data warehousing, automation and integration.  

I'm motivated by the desire to solve real world problems and to automate as much as possible.  The automation aspect scares many people, but the way I look at it, automating the boring stuff allows you to focus on the new and interesting stuff.  

The pace of innovation is ever increasing and it is impossible to keep up with everything, but this site represents my attempts to do just that.
