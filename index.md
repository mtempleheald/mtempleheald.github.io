This site serves several purposes.  
1. Dumping ground of information that I've considered useful at some point or think that I will do in the future.  
   The pace of innovation is ever increasing and it is impossible to keep up with everything, but this site represents my attempts to do just that, or at least focus my efforts.  
2. Portal/ hub for any open source work I've done that I think may be useful or interesting to others.  
   I read a lot of technical documentation, but the best way to learn is by doing, this approach ties my investigations to my hands-on experience.  
3. Part of a wider programme of self improvement.  
   Specifically implementing a single source of the truth to organise my life, separating public from private, personal from professional and removing repetition.  

The site is entirely for my benefit, but if it helps me get work then great, an incentive to keep things public.  

The site is set up in a way that should encourage me to keep it up to date regularly, however I'm not promising that either the facts written or my opinions haven't changed since writing.  

My approach is therefore not to repeat all the useful and detailed information out there that I've in many cases read multiple times over, but instead to summarise succinctly and reference the original source instead.  This should be the best of both worlds.  

I'm keen to avoid the blog mentality, where the first half of each entry is explaining the purpose, the useful information disappearing in a sea of text further down, I should instead be able to reference high level concepts with a simple link.
