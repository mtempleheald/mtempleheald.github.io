<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I’ve worked as a professional software developer since 2008 and dabbled for years before that.<br>
I’ve worked with dozens of programming languages, frameworks and platforms.<br>
I’ve performed:</p>
<ul><li>data modelling (relational, dimensional and hierarchical) and technical design</li>
<li>development</li>
<li>testing (manual, automated and performance)</li>
<li>analysis (business and technical)
With many different ways of working</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Waterfall, Agile, Kanban, Scrum</li>
<li>Solo projects, local teams, cross-site teams, off shore teams, cross-discipline teams, off the shelf product configuration</li>
<li>Version control (none, PVCS, SVN, TFSVC, Git)</li></ul>
<p>I consider my primary skill to be the ability to understand new topics quicker than most.<br>
More often than not I’ll reach a practical level of understanding and not dig deeper than necessary.</p>
<p>What really motivates me is designing practical solutions to a real world problems, using existing knowledge but always considering alternatives.<br>
In order to do that I think it is absolutely critical to be <em>T-shaped</em>.<br>
In my case that means that I can do testing and business analysis but I’m strong when it comes to technical design, development and, I like to think, architecture.</p></main>

		modernism means meticulously managing many mistakes, misconceptions, misunderstandings. Measured
		multipronged musings, mechanical movements, may maximise meritorious magnificence.
