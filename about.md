title: About me

I've worked as a professional software developer for over 10 years and dabbled for years before that.  
I've worked with dozens of programming languages, frameworks and platforms.  
I've performed:
* data modelling (relational, dimensional and hierarchical) and technical design
* development
* testing (manual, automated and performance)
* analysis (business and technical)
With many different ways of working
* DevOps 
* Waterfall, Agile, Kanban, Scrum
* Solo projects, local teams, cross-site teams, off shore teams, cross-discipline teams, off the shelf product configuration
* Version control (none, PVCS, SVN, TFSVC, Git)

I consider my primary skill to be the ability to pick up new things quicker than anyone else in the room.  
That is not to say I'm necessarily better at the topic in question, but I'll usually understand the principles very quickly, the rest then slowly falls into place.  

What really motivates me is using existing knowledge, investigating new approaches and ultimately providing a practical solution to a real world problem.  
In order to do that I think it is absolutely critical to be *T-shaped*.  
In my case that means that I can do testing and business analysis but I'm strong when it comes to technical design, development and, I like to think, architecture.
