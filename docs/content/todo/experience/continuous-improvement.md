I believe in continuous improvement & learning, this is what separates humans from every other creature on the planet.  
Once you embrace the approach of treating everything as a learning opportunity you stop fearing change and start seeking it out, this is when things start getting interesting.  





A versatile IT professional with 10 years experience and a proven track record of delivering robust technical solutions built on solid architecture principles.  

Primarily involved with software development and data modelling but also with environment automation, test automation, technical design and functional analysis.  

Motivated by the use of technology to provide real business benefit, inspired by technical challenges and the never-ending desire to learn.  

Strong belief in agile principles but not committed to any formal methodology.  

Technology agnostic but favour code over configuration, libraries over frameworks, automation whenever possible.  

Looking to secure a role in a challenging, progressive business where I can make a meaningful contribution.  




A versatile and experienced software professional with a proven track record of delivering high quality technical solutions which satisfy real world business requirements and are well understood by both peers and end users.

I believe that putting more effort in early on can drastically reduce future effort and this is an approach I strive for in everything I do.  I have proven this on many occasions, including developing my own data warehouse ETL framework and automating builds and deployments of Oracle applications.

I find the technical aspects of my work more interesting than the application, however I am always aligned to the holistic, strategic vision.  I am continually improving my technical skills by exploring alternatives, for example I'm currently learning Haskell, refreshing my knowledge of front end JavaScript libraries and working on a couple of small projects using Golang.



Over the years I've worked on quite a few projects, no two projects are ever the same:
* Process
    * Waterfall vs Agile (or something in between)
    * Solo vs local vs geographically dispersed vs outsourced off-shore development
* Technology
    * Oracle vs Microsoft
    * Cloud vs internal hosting
    * 4GL frameworks (APEX, Forms, BI Publisher) vs 3GL programming languages (C#, Java, Go, Rust, Haskell, Powershell)
    * Git vs TFSVC vs SVN vs PVCS vs None(!!!)
    * Application development vs database design vs integration
* Business areas
    * Finance
    * Human Resources and external human resources
    * Product development
    * Event management
    * Examination processing
    * Management Information and Business Intelligence
* Reimbursement
    * Paid vs continuous improvement  
  

A list of some of the more noteworthy projects are listed below.

## Serverless darts scoreboard app (Rust, web assembly, Azure)
ðŸ“† *2018*  

ðŸ’¡ Implement a simple yet fully featured web application using a serverless architecture in Azure with Rust and Rust compiled to web assembly for maximum code reuse.  



## Darts scoreboard web application (Rust)
ðŸ“† *2017*  

ðŸ’¡ Learn Rust by building a simple, yet fully featured web application, try to use higher order functions and a "functional style".  




## LinkedIn web scraper and CV generator (Golang + LaTeX)
ðŸ“† *2016*  

ðŸ’¡ Produce an aesthetically pleasing and practical CV semi-automatically using information already added to LinkedIn.  




## Aristotle's number puzzle (Haskell)
ðŸ“† *2015*

ðŸ’¡ Learn functional programming in Haskell by solving a pure mathematical problem quickly.  

This was not a quick exercise, consisting of several stages:
0. Get up to speed with the functional programming paradigm through reading and watching videos online, triggered by encountering lambda expressions in C#.  
   The principles really struck a chord with me, addressing many of my concerns with OOP, especially with stateless web applications, hence this project.
1. Configure development environment, on Windows at the time this seemed unnecessarily complicated, yet easy to get started when done.
2. Learn Haskell basics
    * basic program structure
    * package management
    * test automation
    * common libraries
3. Apply the basics to try to solve the problem
    * establish a mathematical algorithm for solving the solution as a set of simultaneous equations.
    * end up digging into more advanced topics on monads etc, understanding the gist but insufficiently experienced to understand the details.
    * produce a dozen ways of achieving the target solution, all way more complicated than needed.
    * wait hours, days even for badly written solutions to never return an answer
4. Have a moment of realisation that the order of a set of simultaneous equations is important
    * ultimately, under all of the syntactic sugar lies a set of a chained functions which execute in order.
    * rewrite everything in about 20 lines of code, completes in seconds with 6 solutions which reduce down to 1 when taking into account symmetry.  


## SVN build tool (Golang)
ðŸ“† *2014*
