AQA is an independent education charity and the largest provider of academic qualifications taught in schools and colleges in the UK.  

Key achievements:  
* Played a pivotal role in the introduction of a new Microsoft BizTalk Enterprise Service Bus to support digital transformation.  
* Architected, dimensionally modelled and delivered an Oracle 11g data warehouse for ad hoc analytical reporting.  
* Designed and delivered in excess of 10 high quality web applications in Oracle APEX with proven longevity (10 years).  
* Demonstrated a clear proficiency for acquiring new technical skills across multiple technology stacks.  
* Exhibited excellent adaptability, a willingness to collaborate, continuously improve and mentor.  

My role evolved significantly over the years, loosely as follows but with significant overlap:
1. Development, testing and third line support of existing internal Oracle applications.  
2. Relational modelling, design and delivery of new internal applications, primarily Oracle APEX.  
3. Dimensional modelling, data warehouse design and ETL development.  
4. XML and JSON data modelling and integration between on-premise, Azure infrastructure and third party systems.  

My work at AQA touched on every system and spanned many areas of the business including finance, HR, product development, event management, examination processing, management information and business intelligence.  
I've worked independently and collaboratively with business stakeholders, architects, project managers, developers, testers, TechOps and partner organisations.  
I've worked on waterfall projects, projects with various flavours of agile and with several flavours of version control (PVCS, SVN, TFSVC, Git).  

More details of particular projects undertaken at AQA are available below.

* Delivered by a third party supplier as part of a waterfall project, significant work required prior to production release.  
* Reworked all aspects of the application to ensure that it met business requirements including:
    * authentication mechanism involving token exchange with bespoke applications and active directory
    * rewriting key sampling algorithm for multiple execution, improving performance and supportability
    * fixing UI performance issues caused by the use of inefficient queries and unnecessary caching.

## AQA - Electronic coursework mark submission (performance testing)
ðŸ“† *2015*

ðŸ’¡ Evaluate the performance of the new coursework mark capture platform to provide the business with confidence for a production roll-out.  

* Scripting of automation tests using Neoload for critical paths identified during manual testing, requiring an unusual collection of knowledge (Oracle APEX, JavaScript, regular expressions, HTTP).
* Profiling of script execution, establishing acceptance criteria and identifying pinch points.
* Collaborating with colleagues across many technical disciplines; network, engineering, security, development, quality assurance in order to provide solutions to critical issues encountering during performance testing, this was not a trivial exercise.

## AQA - Electronic marks processing
ðŸ“† *2014 â€“ 2015*

ðŸ’¡ Electronic marking is a key component of exam processing, faster and more reliable than traditional marking.  
Provide a solution which integrates with our partner organisation's system to allow us to diversify our online marking portfolio.  

* Delivered 9 Oracle Forms for user maintenance of data required to support integration to a third party SOAP webservice.
* Delivered 9 integration units comprising validation and transformation between database and XML.
* Optimised performance of the most critical integration unit; capturing marks.  
    * Early estimates were for up to 30 million marks in June 2015 with future expansion anticipated.  
    * Actual numbers were roughly half this, there have been no performance issues up until Nov 2018.  
    * Benchmarked to ~ 6 hours for processing 3,000,000 item marks, well within require parameters.

## Item aggregation rules engine
ðŸ“† *2014 â€“ 2015*

ðŸ’¡ A typical exam paper has a set of rubrics (rules) which allow or disallow certain combinations of questions/ items.  
These rubrics can be complex and independent of the question paper's ragged hierarchical structure.  
Provide an algorithm to efficiently aggregate item marks for a question paper based upon user-maintained data.  

* Designed database structures to hold:
    * human readable representation of aggregation rules, maintained in Oracle Forms
    * generated sets of valid combinations at both rule level (question) and at leaf node level (item)
* Developed processes to efficiently (benchmark 3,000,000 item marks, or 1/10 peak month load):
    * apply rule sets to incoming marks to determine the best aggregated mark < 1 hour
    * update grading application with aggregated marks ~ 2 hours
    * send item mark data to data warehouse for further reporting ~ 4 minutes

## AQA - Automated build generation tool
ðŸ“† *2014*

ðŸ’¡ Provide an automated solution for the deployment of code, to increase developer productivity, improve auditing and reliability of releases.  

* Delivered a web application built in Go (Golang) to automate builds:
    * Database builds are 2-step:
        1. generate a single publish script by amalgamating individual scripts and add logging.
           This is made possible through configuration files aligned to the repository file structure. 
        2. manually login to the database and publish the script
    * Operating system builds are also 2-step
        1. automatically transfer build scripts to the remote server via secure copy (scp)
        2. manually login to the server and execute the deployment (command provided in step 1).  
           Deployment mechanism itself is written in the server's shell; Linux Bash or VMS DCL.

ðŸ’¡ Internal APEX applications look outdated, provide a more modern theme which is future proof and mobile-friendly.  

* Designed a suite of replacement theme templates (HTML5, CSS3), adhering to the tenets of:
    * Cross-browser compatibility, develop for modern browsers and use polyfills and unobtrusive JavaScript to support legacy browsers
    * W3C standards compliance and the semantic web
    * Mobile-friendly where possible, optimised for office desktop
    * Discourage deviations from web standards made possible by existing themes, e.g. embedded styles and scripts.
