Let me be very clear, I have no issues with working with individual off shore developers, I like to think I have built up reasonable relationships in this area.<br/>
However, if you aren’t supporting the production software then you shouldn’t be building it and you sure as hell shouldn’t be designing it!<br/>
Typically off shore staff won’t have access to an enterprise production system and there is rarely anything resembling an effective handover.
Basically the cost savings are misleading as they do not represent a holistic view of the end to end process. If you take into account the non-tangible factors such as staff morale things get even worse.`,ee,T,je=`Agile development is effective, however nobody in enterprise is doing agile development. Typically they’ll be process-less (reactive, risky), waterfall (slow, inefficient) or trying to follow some variant of ScrumBan/FrAgile, i.e another process people don’t quite get but go along with and see little benefit from.<br/>
I would describe true agile as organised chaos, everyone can do their bit their way as long as these approaches come together to meet a collective (holistic!) vision to produce an effective and supportable end result.<br/>
This is ultimately how I like to work, I don’t (can’t) follow a plan, but I always refer back to the vision/goal/target.<br/>
All too often agile is just viewed as “develop quickly” with timeboxes to keep management happy.<br/>
Mostly I think this comes down to the lack of a clear vision. Product owners are meant to solve this issue, however it is exceedingly rare to find someone who truly understands both the technical and the business requirements sufficiently to make informed decisions.`,te,M,qe=`Project management is ineffective.<br/>
On paper (and over-simplified) project management is the act of balancing scope, time, budget and quality.<br/>
In my experience project managers do not understand the scope and are not interested in learning, and they have no interest in quality.<br/>
The end result of this is that poor quality products are produced which are either late because of scope creep or delivered without important features, leading the customers to find alternative, inefficient methods to fill the void. Again, this indicates a lack of a holistic vision.<br/>
Oh but high level management is happy because they get green reports every week!`,ie,H,Oe="Trends",ne,I,Ae=`Disruption is no longer the exception but the norm.<br/>
Time and again big business gets stuck its “this is how we do things” bubble and starts to stagnate.<br/>
Someone, somewhere sees an opportunity, perhaps they used to work in the industry and got too frustrated so they set up a competitor.<br/>
These startups are free from the bullshit and red tape in enterprise, free from technical debt and embrace new technologies and processes.<br/>
Yes, some of these fail, there are countless possible reasons for this, I’m confident that it is not because the enterprise responds.`,oe,L,Re=`OOP solved a very real problem of ever increasing software complexity.
However, in this highly distributed world where the ability to horizontally scale can be the difference between success and failure, it is no longer the most effective approach, yet adds significant complexity.
Functional programming languages (and functional extensions to OOP languages) are on the rise.
Mutability in particular is the enemy of good code, responsible for arguably the majority of live bugs, particularly around concurrency.`,ae,_,ze=`In my opinion one of the keys to success (in general but especially in software development) is to move the problem forwards.<br/>
Ultimately this means prefer buildtime bugs over runtime, prefer automated testing (QA) over manual testing and avoid “happy path” bullshit.
A decade ago Java was king, production hosting in the JVM, complex build systems and still production debugging nightmares were commonplace.<br/>
Now there is a rise in languages and compilers which move this problem back to buildtime.
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a> is an extremely popular up and coming language which is built around immutability by default, type safety and the borrowchecker, which collectively make it impossible to experience certain types of bugs in production environments.`,se,P,De=`Web frameworks (Angular, React, Vue…) solve a real problem; more and more code is running on the client and hand written JavaScript quickly gets out of control.
However, these tend to be bulky bundles which bloat the website they’re used on and provide a poor user experience with lazy loading causing pages to jump around.<br/>
There is a rise in languages which compile to JavaScript in addition to TypeScript; <a href="https://elm-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Elm</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow">Svelte</a> are two that I like the look of.<br/>
Elm guarantees no runtime errors, in much the same way Rust eliminate concurrency bugs.<br/>
Svelte simply enables the developer to work in the target technology (html/css/js) yet offers benefits such as consistency, modularity, scoped styling and tiny bundle sizes.
There are some great presentations on YouTube by Evan Czaplicki (Elm) and Rich Harris (Svelte) on the thought processes leading to this new way of thinking, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao" rel="nofollow">Rethinking Reactivity</a>.
Web assembly is also on the rise with tools like Blazor, Yew and Seed, which allow non-Node developers the option to share code between front and backend.<br/>
These newer, more lightweight web frameworks play better with others than the large web frameworks.`,re,S,Ee=`I personally <strong>hate</strong> modern web design; every site looks the same, I can rarely find the information I’m looking for, the cookie banners are infuriating and I have little confidence that my choice to decline is being heeded. I would have no issue with cookies if this were a site that needed it, but I just clicked on a blog, or a homepage somewhere, I haven’t seen anything yet, why do you think you deserve access to my data? Earn it first!
I believe much of this is due to the rise of these bloated frameworks and Google/Facebook are responsible for the rest.<br/>
New browser features such as reading view are a game changer, but marketing teams need to adapt - stop tracking people, start understanding/ tracking your product!

Well written code is modularised and easy to reason about in any language/paradigm (within reason), badly written code is not.
Badly written monoliths are still supportable, as long as you’re comfortable in the debugger and have sufficient computing resource.<br/>
It takes discipline to write a monolith well and more importantly to ensure that it stays well written over the years.
Microservices are meant to solve that problem (amongst others), it becomes far harder to take shortcuts, but it still happens (sigh!).
Badly written microservices are not supportable, don’t even consider microservices if you’re not investing in the time to create a functional test suite.<br/>
