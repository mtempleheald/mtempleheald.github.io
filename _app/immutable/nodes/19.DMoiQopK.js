These websites had been left to rot, were running old versions of the software and the software team were unable to respond effectively to changing business requirements.
The decision was made to consolidate the different sites into a single multisite instance to maximise code sharing and faciliate easier upgrades and security patches.
This migration was planned over a very short timescale and therefore third party service providers were needed to make up the developer resource shortfall.`,y,h,L="The situation",x,m,I=`<li>1 .NET Framework MVC solution with global configuration and shared components</li> <li>IIS Hosting on Windows VMs, limited to 3 environments (no infrastructure automation, sadly):
