I have developed quite strong opinions on what amongst these works well.<br/>
With this in mind I’ve structured this website according to the following principles:`,M,v,A="<li><strong>Video</strong> can be useful but is not an efficient way to learn, I always look for the written transcript.</li> <li><strong>Blog</strong> insufficient on its own - very focused points are great, if you’re trying to achieve the same thing, but at least it is timely.</li> <li><strong>Topical documentation useful</strong> but there must be an indication of timeliness or the information can’t be trusted.</li> <li><strong>Succinct</strong> - I’m sick of reading long introductions and caveats in blogs, this is written for my level of understanding not as click bait.</li> <li><strong>Detailed</strong> - when reading an article I shouldn’t need to go off-site to fill in <em>important</em> gaps, the document should stand alone.</li> <li><strong>Focused</strong> - documentation should be modular just as code should, split dependencies or sidetracks into a separate document.</li> <li><strong>Avoid repetition</strong> - if there’s a good, detailed blog somewhere else for the same topic, just reference that and add benefit.</li> <li><strong>Mobile-friendly</strong> is important, cosmetics and user experience not so much, I am the target audience.</li>",L,g,B="Commitment",T,b,D=`I’ve spent a considerable amount of time configuring this site to suit my needs and facilitate simple ongoing maintenance.<br/>

My only commitment is that the information provided here was true to the best of my knowledge at the time of writing.<br/>
