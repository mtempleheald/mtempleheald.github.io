But will it just be grabbed by early adopters and will the big players somehow ruin things for everyone like any other cryptocurrency? It would be nice to see a cap in place so that once it reaches critical mass nobody will make a direct profit from their contributions. I need to understand more but this is a very complex and ambitious project.</p> <hr>`,1);function h(e){var o=l();a(28),t(e,o)}export{h as component};
