<main class="svelte-lv7236"><h1>Headless CMS</h1>
<p>I’ve been working on a 100% data-driven, low code solution using SvelteKit.<br>
I’ve been debating rolling my own highly specialised CMS admin pages vs using an off the shelf headless CMS.</p>
<h2>The requirements</h2>
<ol><li>Data structure</li></ol>
<p>Must support a data structure similar to the below.<br>
All levels in the hierarchy can repeat, components of any type can be swapped in and out and everything can be reordered.</p>
<pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">- journey
  - page
    - section
      - component
    - repeating group
      - section
        - component</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<ol start="2"><li>REST API</li></ol>
<p>GraphQL may be better, but it adds complexity and security concerns, I want this to be as simple as possible.
The data structure should look similar to above without requiring significant knowledge of the inner workings of the CMS.</p>
<ol start="4"><li>Ease of use</li></ol>
<p>The content editor needs to understand context at all times.<br>
e.g. We are editing a section within page X, journey A, not editing a section then going to find a page to link it to.<br>
This is important for scalability and to reduce human errors.  </p>
<ol start="5"><li>Safety</li></ol>
<p>Developers must be able to edit content types, and content editors must be able to edit content using these types, without ever losing data.<br>
This is important for deployment and publishing purposes.  </p>
<ol start="6"><li>Versioning</li></ol>
<p>Relating to safety but more about compliance; we must be able to view the change history for content and rollback if necessary.  </p>
<ol><li>Lightweight</li></ol>
<p>I want a pure headless solution, not a full solution that I’m only using the headless features of.<br>
This is for security, upgrade, complexity reasons but should also keep costs down.  </p>
<ol start="8"><li>Hosting</li></ol>
<p>I know how to host .NET and Node apps, either will suffice.  As long as it is secure.  No PHP.  </p>
<h1>The contenders</h1>
<p>Starting with free options, because why wouldn’t you?<br>
I deliberately timeboxed this work to a few hours per option.<br>
If a competent developer can’t get to grips with managing a basic structure in a few hours then content editors won’t be able to work with it.  </p>
<h2>Strapi</h2>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul><li>Top of the most popular list on <a href="https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/" rel="nofollow">Jamstack</a>.</li>
<li>Free (until you want granular controls or SSO)</li>
<li>Open Source MIT licence</li>
<li>Very easy to get started, up and running in under 20 minutes from nothing but a node command line</li>
<li>REST API extremely easy to use, up and running locally in under an hour with token authentication allowing me to grab a draft page by url and related journey.</li>
<li>Easy to see what’s going on with the content types appearing in the code as JSON schemas with boilerplate API wrappers</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul><li>Can only nest components one deep using the dynamic zone feature.<br>
This means that managing components within sections is nice, but linking these back up to pages and those back up to journeys is cumbersome.<br>
The relationship feature can make this work, but it seems you have to manage the one-to-many side of the relationship and also the many-to-one side, i.e. list pages within journey and link page back to parent journey.</li>
<li>Search filters are lost during navigation.
I’m not sure if this is a bad thing, but it frustrated me during my brief trial.</li>
<li>Interface is clunky.  It never let me break anything or lose changes, but I had to try, see the popup and remember to save rather than this being immediately apparent.</li>
<li>The first thing I tried to do was create a component with an id.<br>
This clashed with the id added by default, something of an oversight if you ask me.</li>
<li>Creating content types writes JSON files to disk, in the solution, so presumably I’d deploy this the way I would any other web app, from git.
Content writes to database.
I fail to see the connection between these which makes me worry about deployment safety.<br>
This correlates with many comments regarding Strapi too; deployments breaking sites.</li></ul>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Nice try but not good enough yet.
I like how it feels, I like the simplicity, but it needs that extra depth in the hierarchy and some refinements.</p>
<h2>OrchardCore</h2>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul><li>Free</li>
<li>Open source BSD3 licence</li>
<li>Written in .NET which is in my tech stack already</li>
<li>Once I figured out the built in Bag and Title content parts it was very easy to get exactly the structure I was looking for</li>
<li>Security taken seriously, countless authentication options with details of openid</li>
<li>I already know how to implement SSO with Azure AD in .NET Core so that’s one problem I don’t have to worry about.</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul><li>Documentation is thorough yet many broken links, including the video to getting started with headless CMS in OrchardCore.
I didn’t see <a href="https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/docs/getting-started/" rel="nofollow">this</a> at first.<br>
Why they’d make download more prominent I have no idea, I ended up just taking full latest source code as my basis for trial.</li>
<li>Headless content APIs not as easy to use as Strapi, nor as easy to integrate with.
Just for trial purposes I set up token authentication and this achieved my goal of pulling down some content.</li>
<li>REST APIs rather limited, only allowing reference by ID at first glance.
Possible to use Queries instead of going straight to content, but this requires configuring Lucene indexes etc (TODO)</li></ul>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>I like it at a glance, have no concerns about scalability or usability.<br>
The API/Query complexity makes me wary - anytime there’s an index/cache involved things start getting complicated.<br>
I will complete the API PoC work, use the NuGet-driven setup process and re-evaluate.</p></main>

  <p>Mindful meanderings manifest more manageable machinations.
    Manoeuvring murky multifaceted modernism means meticulously managing many mistakes, misconceptions, misunderstandings.
    Measured multipronged musings, mechanical movements, may maximise meritorious magnificence.
