<main class="svelte-lv7236"><pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">As a software professional with a limited public presence
I require a public area in which to capture technical notes, investigations and anything else worth sharing
In order to reduce time wasting and search repetition</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>I’ve got code and technical documentation all over the place:</p>
<ul><li>Google drive</li>
<li>OneNote</li>
<li>An ancient php blogging platform I wrote and forgot about, inspired by WordPress </li>
<li>External hard drives</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>BitBucket</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Private Slack channels</li></ul>
<p>I needed to consolidate in such a way as to make it future proof, it must also be easy and consistent or else I’ll stop using it.<br>
When I found out about <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="nofollow">GitHub Pages</a> I was almost excited; automated deployment, version control built in, I get to write in markdown in my favourite editor (VS Code), this could work…</p>
<p>I’m trying to address only the public stuff here, but there are 2 elements to consider:</p>
<ul><li>Structured store of useful information - to replace bookmarks, reduce search repetition and consolidate thoughts</li>
<li>Blogging - time-dependent information, written for an external audience, or just don’t know where else to put it
I see no reason why these 2 elements can’t co-exist, so that’s what I’m working towards, a structure platform of information with an attached blog.  </li></ul>
<h3>Initial Setup</h3>
<p>So I followed the basic instructions:  </p>
<ol><li>Create github repository mirroring my username, followed by .github.io</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Ruby</a> (dependency of Jekyll)</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> Ruby Gem</li>
<li>Selected a GitHub Pages theme, specifically <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight" rel="nofollow">Midnight</a></li></ol>
<p>And I had a formatted static website running based on the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/" rel="nofollow">default project structure</a>, testable locally.  </p>
<h3>Customisation</h3>
<p>I started migrating existing blog entries and creating new structures for my personal data store.<br>
It didn’t take too long before the theme started irritating me, starting with the padding around lists of lists.<br>
Also I didn’t like the link back to GitHub or the author’s account, this is MY blog.  </p>
<p>So I started customising, firstly by overriding the CSS:</p>
<ul><li>create style.css file in /assets/css</li>
<li>include the standard theme css as a starter for ten <code>CSS (@import &quot;{{ site.theme }}&quot;;</code></li></ul>
<p>Next I wasn’t happy with the HTML itself, so I made a copy of the theme’s <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight/blob/master/_layouts/default.html" rel="nofollow">default layout</a> and put it in the _layouts directory.<br>
I was then able to tweak it to my heart’s content, but I was effectively no longer using the theme, so it made little sense to keep it as a dependency.  </p>
<p>Digging into the source code of the theme, I could see that the theme itself subscribed to a theme, namely <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/primer" rel="nofollow">jekyll-theme-primer</a>.  I switched to this to see what would happen:  </p>
<ul><li>open _config.yml</li>
<li>alter the theme entry to jekyll-theme-primer</li></ul>
<p>I was happy with the results, basically normalised CSS added and not much else, a bit more going on if you browse the source code but it wasn’t affecting me so I left it and just tweaked the CSS to my liking.  </p>
<p>I’m no web designer, more technical back end stuff and integration, but I know enough not to just wing it here.  So I went looking for colour combinations that work and stuck to the standard centred blog layout.  </p>
<p>I ended up opting for the VS Code dark+ colour scheme, since I’m used to staring at it, I found enough information in <a href="https://github.com/dunstontc/dark-plus-everywhere" rel="nofollow">dunstontc’s GitHub project</a> to get this done.  </p>
<h3>Becoming Productive</h3>
<p>By now I had a reasonable grasp of how Jekyll works, where to find things and how to reference <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/" rel="nofollow">variables</a>.<br>
I had created a menu bar with a basic structure which I’ll tweak as and when, including a link to the Blog.  </p>
<p>I decided to opt for a data-driven menu:</p>
<ul><li>create a _data folder</li>
<li>add a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/navigation/" rel="nofollow">toc.yml</a> file containing the data I’m interested in</li></ul>
<p>This way I can write a document at my leisure and nobody will see it until I’m good and ready to add a link to it (unless they’re looking at my source code).  </p>
<p>Finally, I had blog pages but nothing pointing to them, so I have added blog.md containing a loop through the site.posts variable as per the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll documentation</a>.  </p>
<p>So now I’ve got a static web page running, which is:</p>
<ul><li>easy to maintain using simple markdown</li>
<li>easy to restructure information</li>
<li>blog-ready, with %seo% Jekyll tags, I’ve not spent any time on this for RSS feeds etc</li>
<li>Public so that I can link to it from LinkedIn and my CV</li>
<li>A home page referencing all public projects I’ve been working on, in a manner of my choosing.</li></ul>
<p>The future’s bright, the future’s GitHub Pages.</p>
<h3>Upgrading Jekyll (edit)</h3>
<p>I recently had a github security warning relating to one of Jekyll’s dependencies (nokogiri).  I’m not a Ruby developer so fixing this wasn’t quite as obvious as you’d hope.  For future reference the approach is to simply run <code>bundle update jekyll</code> or just <code>bundle update</code>.  Bundle is the Ruby package (gem) manager so obviously requires Ruby to be installed but I’d removed this during a tidyup.  After installation though everything just worked and the security warning has gone</p></main>
