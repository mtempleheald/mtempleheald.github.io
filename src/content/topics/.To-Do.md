# TO DO

Much of the content here has been copy-pasted from an older version using different technology (Svelte replacing Jekyll).  
Many tweaks needed, some stuff private for now, other bits don't format properly, some bits my attitude has evolved too.

- Topic organisation (tech, process, global...)
- Snarkdown replacement - love the idea of markdown as a regexp, but either there are implementation issues or it is just too limited even for me
- Catch up on professional work of the last 2 years (why do I do it to myself? never again...)
-
