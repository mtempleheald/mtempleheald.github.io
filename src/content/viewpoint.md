- I work to a vision, not to a plan, any plan is out of date the moment it is produced.  
  My most valuable skill is being able to break a vision down into deliverable chunks.
  This skills comes from detailed focussed technical knowledge as well as wider industry comparisons.
- Business priorities should be bottom up not top down, the vision may be top down but not the prioritisation.
  Clear and transparent reporting and dashboards are essential to facilitate this, if the higher ups don't see summaries they will interfere.
- Hierarchy has no place in modern society, I work _with_ people not _for_ people, I work only _for_ the company.
  Directors work on strategic not tactical or operational work and get paid more, but that does not make them special.
- Marketing is evil and unnecessary.
  Its sole purpose is to encourage people to purchase things they do not need, to make money without offering tangible benefits in return.  
  Time and resources would be better spent improving the products they're selling; let the product speak for itself.
  I believe it is possible to achieve the same returns by adopting a user-driven approach, track the product not the customer.
  I will actively seek similar products which seemingly spend less money on marketing, knowing that the product will likely be of higher quality.
  User tracking and profiling is a marketer-driven industry responsible for a great deal of harm starting with data harvesting, targetted advertising and echo chambers and culminating with the rise of hate groups and the facilitation of large scale manipulation of political opinion.
- Capitalism has gone too far and reached end of life.  
  It opened up social mobility and vastly improved living conditions for millions but now most of us just work to buy things that don't benefit us. The poor get poorer, the rich get richer, advertising gets more and more invasive and mental health continues to decline.
  Whole industries have opened up, large media empires merged (narrowly avoiding monopoly rules) all in the interests of controlling the situation and increasing inequality.
  It is time to recognise that quality of life is the overarching goal here:
  - we should cut down working hours, at the expense of frittering money, the hours of work are still required, so more job sharing
  - We should cap pay, or better yet have an exponential income tax increase - don't put people off earning big, but ensure that this benefits society rather than damaging it.
