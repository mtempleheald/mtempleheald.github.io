title: Process

Process is as much a part of software development as programming.  
I'm keeping notes on various practices here for my own purposes.  
If you happen to stumble upon this I hope you find it useful, but be sure to understand that:

- the information here comes from personal experience combined with a lot of reading around
- this may be out of date and not represent my latest understanding or opinion on the topic in question
- I'm not interested in being contradicted, disagreements in the workplace are fine, but not here, this is my domain

### [Agile](agile.html)

A big topic this one, but getting these process right are absolutely key to an enjoyable working environment.

### [Information Radiators](information-radiators.html)

Information radiators are a critical component for a self-organising team, being self-organising is of course a critical requirement for success in an agile environment.  
So why is so little effort put into this?

### [Continuous Integration, Deployment and Delivery](ci.html)

DevOps is a way of organising teams.  
Continuous Integration (CI) is effectively mandatory in modern software development, if someone breaks the build they should get near-instant feedback.  
Continuous Deployment (CD) is not mandatory but very much encouraged, dependent on test automation but the positive effect on product confidence far exceeds the investment of time upfront to configure this.

### [Test Driven Development (TDD)](tdd.html)

I don't disagree in principle, except when people get evangelical about it, you have to be pragmatic with any process.  
Writing a bit of code to pass a test which you know is of no real world use is just plain wrong.

### [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](ddd.html)

Relatively new to me this one, basically design patterns for business analysis as a parallel to SOLID design principles.
