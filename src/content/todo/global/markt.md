### Markt

A moneyless marketplace, based upon smart contracts and a token unit of exchange made up of:

- time
- skill
- skill rating - individual rating against this skill, as determined by the market and improved by contribution.  
  This exchange token must be intrinsically hidden so that it cannot be used in currency exchange, as this would undermind the entire principle of this moneyless marketplace.

#### Principles

- Money strictly forbidden - time is the unit of currency here  
  Money is useful to avoid bartering over every transaction  
  However it is also a vast simplification, which allows it to be easily manipulated by those in positions of power.
- Physical objects, e.g. bricks, cleaning fluid are except from the above, the responsibility of the "Requestor" to pay this.
- Skill exchange rate determined by the Markt  
  Bartering banned (or possibly only limited) but skills fairly rewarded, e.g. cleaning windows is worth significantly less per hour than developing software for nuclear power stations.
- Encouraging people to invest in their own skills.
- Encouraging people to contribute to society before they can take advantage of it.
- Encouraging philanthropy, it is possible to contribute to the Markt but not take anything back.
- Encouraging the breakdown in barriers between countries for skills which are not location-specific.
- Helping to reduce the power held by existing government and big businesses in the form of taxes and market manipulation.

#### "Selling" - or more accurately, "Offering"

Individuals would list:

- skills which they are rated for
- location
- time availability
  When an individual agrees to perform an action in response to a request a smart contract is initiated and terms are set but only after agreement from both parties.

###### "Buying" - or more accurately, "Requesting"

You cannot request activity until you have accrued the tokens required to settle the contract.  
A request involves the selection of a skill which is required and a location (if appropriate), this would be listed as an unfulfilled smart contract, awaiting formalisation. Some basic contract terms would be required, built upon contract for similar services previously seen on the Markt.

##### Notes

- Partial contract fulfillment would also no doubt be required, where 1-1 contracts don't work.
- 3 way contracts too, e.g. Web Developer needs cleaner, cleaner needs building work, builder needs web representation.
- and deeper..
- Sadly the complexity of this is mind-boggling, as the contract network could be infinitely deep as could the skill comparison network. I suspect it would need to utilise AI constructs for optimisation and big business wouldn't back it, e.g. how would the typical person rate the contributions of the big audit firms??
