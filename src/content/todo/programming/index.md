title: Links to useful resources
last-updated: 2018-12-07

A collection of links I've found useful which are all tech or process related.  
This replaces my browser-specific bookmarks and reliance on other documentation systems, so hopefully now I can keep it organised.  
I am in no way recommending anything I've linked to.  

[Rust-related links](rust.html)  
[Go-related links](go.html)  
[LaTex-related links](latex.html)  
[Haskell-related links](haskell.html)


### Mind Mapping

Mind mapping is a popular way of organising things for a given topic.  
This is why I'm not sure that mind mapping is for me; I tend to have a few topics which cross streams at a few points, the wiki style feels more natural, what does a mind map give me that this list of links doesn't?  

[Coggle](https://coggle.it/diagram/W1LgH6fTAgAj6sgM/t/-) - Web based, simple to use, efficient shortcuts, markdown links, feels modern, current favourite  
[Wise Mapping](https://app.wisemapping.com/c/maps/3/try) - Web based, a bit clunkier than coggle, looks prettier though
[Sketchboard](https://sketchboard.me) - not just for mind mapping, but software too, I like it but doesn't feel complete yet  
[Mind Manager](https://www.mindjet.com/mindmanager/) - Desktop app, free trial only, personally recommended to me but I haven't tried it
