### [AQA](aqa.html)  

I worked at AQA as a software developer for 10 years, August 2008 to November 2018.  
I started as a developer/tester, specialised as a developer, became a senior developer

### [Continuous Improvement](continuous-improvement.html)

I am a strong believer in the need to continously improve, whatever it is you're doing.  
This is especially important in the world of software development, things move very quickly, it is very easy to fall behind.
