I think that blockchain itself offers little to most companies or individuals, nothing that can't be done more easily with traditional databases or key-value stores.  
The only exception I can think of off-hand is possibly accounting in the interests of avoiding corruption and manipulation.

### Distributed blockchain

I'd say that distributed blockchain is likely to have a bigger impact in areas where immutability and trust is of critical importance but privacy may not be:

- electronic voting (obviously privacy is also a concern here)
- stock holdings
- property and land ownership
- patents
- company ownership and liability
  There are issues here though
- For a public ledger to be of any use it must contain meaningful information for multiple observers
- Initiatives such as GDPR mean that blockchain is unsuitable for storing personally-identifiable information.
  Put together this rather limits the usefulness of a distributed blockchain. Ultimately the best the public can hope for in most cases is a public store of reference data which auditors can use to verify that what a company/government says is true, with the backing of an immutable record store.

### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is potentially the biggest disrupting technology possible to challenge the control currently held by government and big business.  
As a global currency I hope some future variant pans out, though I can't see it happening at present.  
Current, too heavily manipulated at present and/or power hungry, almost certainly by the same powers it has the potential to unseat.

### Smart Contracts

I find the idea of smart contracts fascinating and can see this becoming massive in many areas:

- property sales - force all parties to play fair, reducing the number of exchanges falling through
- B2B contracts, e.g. outsourcing contracts
- Loans, or indeed any financial transaction
- Exams processing and awarding - if you fulfil A, B and C we will automatically award you XYZ.
- Formal contracts small businesses which are legal by technical implementation not requiring legal representation at point of agreement
- Formal contracts for renters/ lodgers to bypass useless agencies and push back on unscrupulous landlords
