# The Open Source Revolution


Recent global events have ushered in the move to a cashless society.  
There is a dark side to this, explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XtafuTCWQ0) better than I ever could.  
As with most worrying global issues there are people trying to mitigate this.  One such example is [Libra](https://libra.org) on [GitHub](https://github.com/libra/libra).  
I have serious doubts on the viability of blockchain solutions, the power use of Bitcoin is frankly disgusting and GDPR complicates things significantly, since we can't store sensitive information indefinitely.  If data isn't truly decentralised there's no benefit over a classic relational or NoSQL database.

It is becomes increasingly clear just how powerful the tech giants have become and how damaging this could be to humanity.  
We allowed ourselves to become dependent on the good quality products that they offer in exchange for our data.  
Now I'm seeing a trend with the Google stuff I use to ramp up advertising, actively slow down competitors, ignore my questions instead pushing me towards spending money and just generally being more evil, so it is time to consider switching.  
Apple is a no-go due to pricing and further lock-in, so that leaves open source.

I'm not paranoid, genuinely nothing to hide, but I absolutely detest tracking, marketing, large companies and the erosion of freedom and freewill which comes with the rise of these entities.  
Right now I need: phone, text, banking apps, MFA authentication, WhatsApp, web browsing.
I would also like: cloud file storage access, camera + photo backup (manual is fine) and the option to selectively install other apps, though PWA preferred.  

There are some linux phones in the works:  

- [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/) uses [PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/) - this is quite expensive and doesn't sound like it is ready, but I'll be keeping my eye on this OS.
- [Pro1 X](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pro1-x-smartphone-functionality-choice-control#/) sounds disappointing, I am not taken by the price or the keyboard (considering the impact on form).  
- [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/) looks like the only practical option right now for purchasing a true linux phone.
- [phones that can run linux](https://many.tuxphones.com/)

More practical right now seems to be to de-google an android device:  

- [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/) - the starting place for any Android-based OS
- [LineageOS official device support](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) - pick a phone from this list to start if de-googling
- [/e/ Foundation](https://e.foundation/) - [open source](https://gitlab.e.foundation/e), de-Googled Android OS including practical default apps, also sell phones
- [LineageOS for microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) - include microG essential Google services by default

I am not original in this goal:  

- [Reddit degoogle community](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/)
- [Alternative apps when de=googling](https://impossiblehq.com/complete-guide-leaving-google/)
- [brax.me](https://brax.me/prod/host.php?f=_store&h=rob&p=&version=) sells some de-googled phones in the US and has a YouTube channel where he explains some of the details
- [Martin Pitt](https://piware.de/post/2018-05-01-android-degoogle/) and [part 2](https://piware.de/post/2018-05-21-android-degoogle-2/) - de-googling early 2018
- [Ivan Jurišić](https://www.jurisic.org/index.php?post/2018/09/11/De-Googling-my-phone) - de-googling mid 2018
- [Samuel Walladge](https://www.swalladge.net/archives/2019/06/10/degoogled-android/) - de-googling early 2019
- [hnk @ tweakblogs.net](https://nnk.tweakblogs.net/blog/19000/a-practical-guide-on-de-googling-your-phone) - de-googling late 2020 - LineageOS + microG
- ...

The good news is that it looks feasible as of late 2020, I just need to get organised before my current Android phone dies and I'm forced into a rushed purchase.

I've been following the [Safe Network](https://safenetwork.tech/) made by [Maidsafe](https://maidsafe.net/) for a while now.  I'm intrigued but wary, my biggest concern is safecoin.  At face value this seems like a good solution to the problem of resources for a distributed network.  But will it just be grabbed by early adopters and will the big players somehow ruin things for everyone like any other cryptocurrency?  It would be nice to see a cap in place so that once it reaches critical mass nobody will make a direct profit from their contributions.  I need to understand more but this is a very complex and ambitious project.
