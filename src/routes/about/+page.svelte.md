# About me

I've worked as a professional software developer since 2008 and dabbled for years before that.  
I've worked with dozens of programming languages, frameworks and platforms.  
I've performed:

- data modelling (relational, dimensional and hierarchical) and technical design
- development
- testing (manual, automated and performance)
- analysis (business and technical)
  With many different ways of working
- DevOps
- Waterfall, Agile, Kanban, Scrum
- Solo projects, local teams, cross-site teams, off shore teams, cross-discipline teams, off the shelf product configuration
- Version control (none, PVCS, SVN, TFSVC, Git)

I consider my primary skill to be the ability to understand new topics quicker than most.  
More often than not I'll reach a practical level of understanding and not dig deeper than necessary.

What really motivates me is designing practical solutions to a real world problems, using existing knowledge but always considering alternatives.  
In order to do that I think it is absolutely critical to be _T-shaped_.  
In my case that means that I can do testing and business analysis but I'm strong when it comes to technical design, development and, I like to think, architecture.
