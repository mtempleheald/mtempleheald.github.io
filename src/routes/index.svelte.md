# Introduction

[Mark Temple-Heald](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtempleheald) is an experienced polyglot software developer living in Manchester, UK.  
Technology agnostic but favour code over configuration, libraries over frameworks and automation whenever possible.  
Methodology agnostic but favour prioritisation over planning, collaboration over co-ordination and focus on common understanding throughout.  


## Website Purpose

This website serves many purposes, including:
* public face for my professional work which affords more flexibility than LinkedIn
* centralised list of useful technical references, replacing browser bookmarks and enabling a clear separation of work and home
* centralised information store for technology and processes for which I feel justified to have an opinion
* blog of ongoing investigations where sharing is appropriate or could benefit others
* single source of truth of data for LinkedIn, CV and other professional entities
* encouraging a continuous process of self improvement


## Website Structure and design choices

I spend a lot of time reading technical reference manuals, blogs and videos.  
I have developed quite strong opinions on what amongst these works well.  
With this in mind I've structured this website according to the following principles:  
* **Video** can be useful but is not an efficient way to learn, I always look for the written transcript.
* **Blog** insufficient on its own - very focused points are great, if you're trying to achieve the same thing, but at least it is timely.
* **Topical documentation useful** but there must be an indication of timeliness or the information can't be trusted.  
* **Succinct** - I'm sick of reading long introductions and caveats in blogs, this is written for my level of understanding not as click bait.
* **Detailed** - when reading an article I shouldn't need to go off-site to fill in *important* gaps, the document should stand alone.
* **Focused** - documentation should be modular just as code should, split dependencies or sidetracks into a separate document.
* **Avoid repetition** - if there's a good, detailed blog somewhere else for the same topic, just reference that and add benefit.
* **Mobile-friendly** is important, cosmetics and user experience not so much, I am the target audience.


## Commitment

I've spent a considerable amount of time configuring this site to suit my needs and facilitate simple ongoing maintenance.  
I have every intention of keeping this (or a future version of this) up to date for the rest of my career.  
However, I can not and will not promise to succeed in this aim.  
My only commitment is that the information provided here was true to the best of my knowledge at the time of writing.  
Each page should clearly indicate when it was last updated.  

My opinions are my own and they are in constant flux.  
You may disagree with something I have written, that is absolutely fine, it is entirely possible that I also do too, now.  
I am always interested in learning, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtempleheald) if you think we have something to offer each other in this respect.
